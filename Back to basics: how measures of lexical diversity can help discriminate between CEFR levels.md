Back to basics: how measures of lexical diversity can help discriminate between CEFR levels
- How measures of lexical diversity (LD) can help discriminate between essays from second language learners of English, whose work has been assessed as belonging to levels B1 to C2 of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). 
- How different operationalisations of what constitutes a “different word” (type) impact on the LD measures themselves and on their ability to discriminate between CEFR levels. 
- Results show that basic measures of LD, such as the number of different words, the TTR (Templin 1957) and the Index of Guiraud (Guiraud 1954) explain more variance in the CEFR levels than sophisticated measures, such as D (Malvern et al. 2004), HD-D (McCarthy and Jarvis 2007) and MTLD (McCarthy 2005) provided text length is kept constant across texts. 
- A simple count of different words (defined as lemma’s and not as word families) was the best predictor of CEFR levels and explained 22 percent of the variance in overall scores on the Pearson Test of English Academic in essays written by 176 test takers.

1.	Introduction
Many researchers are trying to find criterial features whose presence or absence can differentiate between these levels albeit in the understanding that there is a great deal of overlap between levels as well as variability within individuals (Bartning, Martin, and Vedder 2010).
Researchers working with measures of lexical diversity (LD), that is measures of the range of words deployed in oral or written language, can potentially make an important contribution to this field of research. (lexical diversity measures are often used as a general purpose measure of spoken and written language (Malvern et al. 2004) or as a measure of complexity at the lexical level (Housen, Kuiken, and Vedder 2012).)

how different operationalizations of what constitutes the basic unit of measurement – the word, the lemma or the word family – affect the LD measures themselves and the ability of the measures to predict CEFR scores

2.	Lexical diversity: 
1)	The term lexical diversity (LD) as this is the term most widely used for the range of words deployed in a text, but are aware that we are in fact only measuring one aspect of lexical diversity, namely lexical variability. (The best known of the traditional measures of LD is the Type-Token Ratio (TTR), which expresses the ratio of different words (types) to total words (tokens) in a given language sample)
 
2)	The key problem with the TTR : “TTR’s for samples of different magnitudes are not directly comparable because of the tendency for the TTR to vary inversely with the size of sample” (Johnson 1944, 2). In other words, the longer the sample, the lower the TTR. 

3)	More recently other measures of LD:
D-value is computed through a series of computations of the Type-Token Ratio (TTR) on samples of different text lengths (typically ranging from 35-50 tokens) after which a random sampling TTR curve is computed (but see McCarthy & Jarvis, 2007, for a critical appraisal of D). 
- HDD is similar to D but based on the hypergeometric distribution function (Wu 1993). HD-D calculates, for each lexical type in a text, the probability of encountering any of its tokens in a random sample of 42 words drawn from the text (McCarthy and Jarvis 2010, 383). 
- The measure of textual diversity (MTLD) is calculated as the mean length of sequential word strings in a text that maintain a given TTR value, which McCarthy and Jarvis (2010) have chosen to be 0.720. (MTLD calculates the TTRs in a sentence until the TTR drops to 0.72, at which point the first factor is complete and TTRs are counted from scratch again: as in the following example: of (1.00) the (1.00) people (1.00) by (1.00) the (.800) 
Subsequently MTLD is obtained by dividing the total number of words by the total number of factors. ( if the text is 360 words long and there are 4 factors, the MTLD value is 90)

☞ very simple counts of the number of types can sometimes be more successful than complex formulae, such as D, in detecting differences between group or within group differences. 
☞ Summarizing the discussion about the measurement of LD is not easy because researchers use different measures and different statistical tests (e.g. regression analysis, discriminant function analysis or simple correlations) to investigate the relationships between variables. 
1)	Studies on the relationships between holistic ratings and measurements of vocabulary diversity of texts ((Grobe’s finding (1981), Yu (2010))


3.	What is a type? The issue of lemmatization
1)	Different Perspectives
(1)	Engber (1995), Lauger(1991) and Jarvis (2002): different inflected forms as a tokens of the same type 
(2)	Duran et al (2004): Similar with 1) but consider fused forms as separate types 
(3)	 Yu: All inflected forms a different types
(4)	Laufer and Nation (1995): use word family as the unit of analysis and include all inflected forms as well as derivational forms listed in Nation and Bauer (1993)

☞ Different lemmatization principles result in different LD scores, and there are significant differences between LD scores for text that have been lemmatized and those that have not been lemmatized (Treffers-Daller 2013)


2)	Evidence from language processing studies can throw new light on the issues of lemmatization
(1)	In English, L2 learners do not automatically have productive knowledge of all the derived forms if they master the stem from – not a good idea to consider the derived forms of a word as one type in analyses of LD in L2 learners
(2)	Morphologically complex forms such as frequent and regular past tense forms in-ed, are not always processed through a decompositional process that segments a word into its different morphemes.  
(3)	The L2 learners know there is a link between a root and a derived or an inflected form, and some inflected and derived forms may be stored as unanalyzed whole in memory. 
3)	Whether or not lemmatization is appropriate also depends on the aims of the research.
(1)	To compare lexical ability across typologically different languages as in Treffers-Daller and Korybski (2016)
(2)	To predict CERF levels on the basis of LD measures, lemmatization may be counterproductive because important regarding a learners’ ability to form complex words and to use inflection is lost in the process of lemmatization. 
4.	Current study 
4.1	Aims and research questions 
1)	To look at how different operationalizations of what constitutes the basic unit of measurement – the word, the lemma, or the word family – affect the LD measures themselves and the ability of the measures to predict CEFR scores 
2)	To find out to what extent text length (number of tokens) affected the scores test takers obtained for their essay. 
3)	Research Questions 
(1)	What is the effect of different types of lemmatization on the LD scores?
(2)	How do different lemmatization principle affect the ability of the LD measures to discriminate between CEFR levels?
(3)	Can newer measures of LD explain additional variance in CEFR scores over and above traditional measures (incremental validity) ?
(4)	To what extent does the length of the students’ essay contribute to the overall scores for the essays as given by Pearson?

4.2	Methodology 
4.2.1. Participants:
 The study included 179 adult English learners from 47 countries, with India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The participants spoke a total of 39 different languages at home, with English being the most frequent.
All students had written an essay as part of taking the Pearson Test of English Academic calibrated to the levels of CEFR (from B1 to C2) 
50 students were selected whose work was classified as B1, B2 or C1 on the basis of the overall test results. For the C2 level, the number of students included in the study was 29 as there were too few students who had reached this level in the database. 

4.2.2 Materials 
The participants had to write 2 writing topics, each essay ranged from 200 to 300 words, with a mean length of 249.47 words. Pearson provided scores on various discrete variables, including vocabulary and writing scores.

4.2.3 Data Treatment 
           1) Data Format: Prior to analysis, the data was converted to CHAT format and proper names, acronyms, cardinal numbers, and incomprehensible words were marked with an ampersand (&) to exclude them from further analysis. 
Spelling Correction: Spelling mistakes were corrected using CHAT conventions to ensure accurate LD calculation. This step is crucial as learners often make spelling errors, which could inflate LD scores if not addressed. 
Abbreviations: Abbreviations were expanded (e.g., "TV" to "television") to maintain consistency and accuracy in the data. 
Exclusion of Non-Existing Words: Non-existing words, such as "trustful" or "solutionated," were excluded from analysis without replacement to prevent inaccurate LD calculations. Only a small number (20) of such errors were present in the dataset.
 Error Handling: Wrong uses of existing words and grammatical errors were not corrected to preserve the original data integrity for analysis


4.2 Lemmatization 
two different ways to lemmatize the data. 
1)	the LEMMA as the unit of analysis. 
4)	all inflected forms of verbs, nouns and adjectives are considered to be tokens of the same type. 
5)	work, working, works and worked are considered to be tokens of the same type, but worker and workable are different types, because they are constitute a different lemma: they are derived from the root work through the addition of derivational suffixes
2)	the WORD FAMILY was chosen as 16 the unit of analysis. 
-all inflected forms and the derived forms up to level 3 in Nation and Bauer (1993) are considered to be tokens of the same type. 

4.3. Results

4.3.1 The effects of lemmatization on the measures of lexical diversity 
1) All measures of lexical diversity reported in this study use types as the basic unit of analysis 
2) When the number of different types is counted on the mor tier, the mean number of types per informant across all CEFR level is 108.72 types (lemma 0)
3) The two different lemmatized versions are 108.55 (lemma 1) and 101.56 (lemma 2)
4) The number of types is higher for the unlemmatized version than for the lemmatized versions, but only the different between lemma 0 and lemma 2 and between lemma 1 and lemma 2 are statistically significant. Type account on Lemma 0 and lemma 1 are not significantly different from each other.
5) If types are counted on the main tier, the number of types in the lemmatized version is lower. The difference between the lemmatized and non-lemmatized versions are not all significant. 
☞ This study used the counts from the main tier in all calculation. 

4.3.2 Lemmatization of LD measures and the CEFR levels 
1) For TTR, the overall differences between the scores for the three lemmatization principles are statistically different. 
2) Same true for the Index of Guiraud 
3) The MTLD is the most powerful one, with an Eta squared values.
4) Only MTLD discriminated between the B1, B2, C1, C2. 
5) The scores for D and HD-D only discriminated between the lowest and the highest CEFR levels
6) Higher Eta squared values for LD measures which did not disambiguate between homographs, which means that making this extra effort was not helpful.

4.3.3 LD measures as predictors of CEFR scores
1) The LD measures correlate strongly and significantly with each other. 
 2) The strongest correlation was found between HD-D and D
3) Moderate correlations between the basic LD measures and the Pearson Scores
: Out of all LD measures, the types correlate most strongly with the overall scores 
And with the writing score
4)	Guiraud correlates most strongly with the vocabulary score. 
5)	MTLD correlates most strongly with the Pearson scores: writing score, overall score, and vocabulary score
