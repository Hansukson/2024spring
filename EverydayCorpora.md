   1) unwillingly
 She then, most unwillingly, asked her sole surviving relative -- her uncle-in-law, Arpad, for a loan. He was the younger brother of Lajos' father, and had been a successful export -- a businessman who owned a factory.

I can't speak any language any more -- not even Hungarian,' he would say. He was a hard worker, but Jane marvelled at how he had been able to build up a business while remaining practically unintelligible.

Mantovani was his favourite' composer'

I do not wish to be like those dumpy, chisel-faced women with shopping baskets who tut-tut scandals to each other between the stacked shelves of dog-food, striped toothpaste, coloured toilet-rolls and instant mashed potato in the supermarket opposite the triangle of Shepherd's Bush Green. I have just one cigarette left. I have also been at work for eighteen hours in an icy room with one thin sandwich

6. CoCA - released

I was released with an " arthritis " diagnosis. Infectious diseases, Rheumatoid, Orthopedics, and Dermatology all saw me. (Dermatology because at the time I had large skin legions on my back that wouldn't heal for over 3 years that bled constantly). Some were over 10cm's big. They nailed me with everything then I was released as a " Can't fix it " case. My wife and I then went to Thailand which we had booked much earlier before all this and I has a terrible trip as you can imagine. However my skin legions actually healed up! Now they're just massive Keloid scars some of which Ive had Tattoo'ed over to hide. # By the Summer that year (so 2008) my Right Knee, Left Hip and Right Hip all became SEVERELY swelled for no real apparent reason.
