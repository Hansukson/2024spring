MTLD, vocd-D, and HD-D: A validation study of sophisticated approaches to lexical diversity assessment 
1.	Three findings 
First, MTLD performs well with respect to all four types of validity and is, in fact, the only index not found to vary as a function of text length. 
Second, HD-D is a viable alternative to the vocd-D standard. 
Third, three of the indices—MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas—appear to capture unique lexical information. 
☞to consider using MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas in their studies, rather than any single index, noting that lexical diversity can be assessed in many ways and each approach may be informative as to the construct under investigation.

2.	CONSIDERATIONS IN THE ASSESSMENT OF LEXICAL DIVERSITY
1)	Text Length
2)	Textual Homogeneity (the distribution of types across a text)
3)	Sequential and Nonsequential Analysis Processing
3.	NDICES OF LEXICAL DIVERSITY
1)	vocd-D: 
(1)	The calculation is the result of a series of random text samplings. The approach begins its calculation by taking from the text 100 random samples of 35 tokens
(2)	The TTR for each of these samples is calculated, and the mean TTR is stored. The same procedure is then repeated for samples from 36 to 50 tokens
(3)	The D coefficient is then used as part of a formula to produce a theoretical curve that most closely fits the empirical TTR curve formed from the random samples.
(4)	The value of the best-fitting D is referred to as D. Because D is arrived at by random sampling, the value varies each time the assessment is run. 
(5)	Thus, to create a higher level of consistency, the procedure above is run three times, and an average D is the final output. 
(6)	Final values tend to range from 10 to 100, with higher values indicating greater diversity.

2)	HD-D
(1)	The hypergeometric distribution represents the probability of drawing (without replacement) a certain number of tokens of a particular type from a sample of a particular size.
(2)	The way we have used this distribution for our own HD-D index is to calculate, for each lexical type in a text, the probability of encountering any of its tokens in a random sample of 42 words drawn from the text.3
(3)	The probabilities for all lexical types in the text are then added together, and the sum is used as an index of the text’s LD.
(4)	It is worth pointing out that vocd-D and HD-D output are also on a different scale. The HD-D output is literally sums of probabilities, whereas vocd-D output is essentially sums of probabilities converted to type–token ratios and, then again, from type–token ratios to a D value
3)	MTLD 
(1)	Processing MTLD
It is calculated as the mean length of sequential word strings in a text that maintain a given TTR value (here, .720). During the calculation process, each word of the text is evaluated sequentially for its TTR
(2)	Partial Factors: A partial factor value is calculated for the lexical remainders of a text (i.e., the final words that do not form a full factor).
(3)	Forward and Reverse Processing
(4)	Calculation of MTLD Value: The total number of words in the text is divided by the total factor count. For example, if the text 340 words and the factor count 4.404, then the MTLD value is 77.203. Two such MTLD values are calculated, one for forward processing and one for reverse processing. The mean of the two values is the final MTLD value
(5)	Factor Size: a default factor size of .720

4.	CONSTRUCT VALIDITY
This study assessed MTLD (along with the more established LD indices: vocd-D, HD-D, Maas, K, and TTR) in relation to the following four types of validity: convergent, divergent, internal, and incremental.
5.	General Discussion 
1)	In terms of convergent validity, MTLD values correlate highly with well-established sophisticated approaches. 
2)	In terms of divergent validity, MTLD does not correlate highly with flawed LD approaches (e.g., TTR) and correlates negatively with approaches that assess the opposite of LD, such as cohesion. 
3)	In terms of internal validity, MTLD results are consistent, regardless of the text length under analysis. 
4)	In terms of incremental validity, MTLD explains textual information that similar approaches do not account for. 

This study demonstrates that MTLD is a powerful index; however, further research is needed to fully explore the many possible variations in its settings. 
5)	vocd-D and HD-D across a wide variety of registers. Our results suggest that the two indices measure the same latent trait. The major difference between the variables in practice may be only that the random sampling of the vocd-D approach leads to greater fluctuations when texts of very high diversity are evaluated.
6)	MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas all appear to be able to capture unique LD information
